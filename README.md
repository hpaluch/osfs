# OpenStack from Scratch (OSFS)

Here is early stage of script to setup single-node OpenStack
under Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.

Why not using DevStack? DevStack install everything from source which
is not typical setup (that is suitable for development). And it is
currently too sophisticated to be easy to understand.

Basically I plan to replicate steps shown on my wiki page:

# Requirements

* Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (it is only OS where OpenStack is actively developed)
* Set up Bridge Interface with static IP address - please
